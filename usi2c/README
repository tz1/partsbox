Reads the ADXL345 analog devices accelerometer.  Slightly above 400khz spec.

Connect SCL to PB2 (pin 7) and SDA to PB0 (pin 5).  Requires pullups on these lines.

Writes out fifo status then X,Y,Z as binary, then 5a,a5 at 2000000 baud to port 1 (pin 6).

Uses a 10Mhz crystal on an ATTiny85/45/25.

(10Mhz for 3.3v - at 5v higher rates would be possible, but the FTDI will only go to 3Mbaud)

You need to do

make fuse
make upload

after adjusting the makefile for your setup, mainly avrdude.
