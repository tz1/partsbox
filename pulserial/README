This is a simple stand-alone program (not a sketch).

The keys are documented in Keys.txt.

1000000 baud.
Two high speed edge measuring.
Three serial data captures.

For example, I wanted to decode the remote serial protocol on the iPod
from a Phillips device, and the Arduino Mega can do it.

IC4 and IC5 (pins 48, 49, ground where convenient) can measure pulse
widths.  I'm using a div8, so 1 count means 0.5 microseconds (16Mhz/8).

Connecting Rx to pin 48 and Tx to pin 49, I can see measured pulse
widths on each - prefixed with the channel (4 or 5) and the edge (/ or
\).  Within the protocol there are 0x55 characters and they end up as
counts just over 100, so the width is just over 50 microseconds, so
the baud rate is probably 19200.

There is rise/fall time, so it won't be 104/104, but might be 96/112.
But it is around a value close to 19200.

(see edges.cap)

Moving the wires to RX1 and RX2, and setting 19200 baud (8), and
enabling the serial (X,Y) (note - I have to leave the ports disabled
as noise or drift will generate lots of junk data).

(see protocol.cap).

Somewhere the text of the playlists, titles, etc. are there, and I
can swich modes (h) to see.
